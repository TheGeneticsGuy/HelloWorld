# Overview

This is a simple Hello World program that takes the concept to a slightly higher level. The real goal here was to demonstrate the ability to break the binds of writing a Hello World that exists ONLY in the terminal console output, whilst utilizing Visual Studio Code, Github, and Pyhon. Let's call it **Hello World 2.0**.

* Start in the Terminal - End in the Web

## Hello World Program

 Rather than just a single typical **Hello World** printout, this takes out on a path of adventure of your choice, but you may find that you may escape the bindings of the terminal and find your journey takes you to the cosmos of the web!
